# In this exercise, you're going to create more synergies between the film and ratings
# tables by using the same techniques you learned in the video exercise to calculate the average rating for every film.

# The PySpark DataFrame with films, film_df and the PySpark DataFrame with
# ratings, rating_df, are available in your workspace.


# Use groupBy and mean to aggregate the column
ratings_per_film_df = rating_df.groupBy('film_id').mean("rating")

# Join the tables using the film_id column
film_df_with_ratings = film_df.join(
    ratings_per_film_df,
    film_df.film_id==ratings_per_film_df.film_id
)

# Show the 5 first results
print(film_df_with_ratings.show(5))
